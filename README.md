# django-tutorial

This project is an open-source project which I made due to sharing my experience around the Django framework.

## What is Django?

Django is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Built by experienced developers, it takes care of much of the hassle of web development, so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel. Itâ€™s free and open source.
